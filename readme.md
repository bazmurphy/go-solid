# SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

1. S - Single Responsibility Principle
2. O - Open-Closed Principle
3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle
4. I - Interface Segregation Principle
5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class or module should have only one reason to change. In other words, it should have only one job or responsibility.

## Open-Closed Principle

The Open-Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle

The Interface Segregation Principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. It suggests breaking down larger interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

By following these principles, you can create more maintainable, flexible, and robust code. Remember that while these principles are important, they should be applied judiciously. Over-engineering can lead to unnecessary complexity, so always consider the specific needs and context of your project when applying these principles.
